## R-Algebra

I have devised a superset of Algebra that surprisingly still keeps one critical rule,
x =|x !

R-Algebra can only be used to derive formulas in algebra!.

= | stands for R-Algebra, so if there is = | and you can prove that a chain of x = |
y works in algebra thats how you can do derivation with R-Algebra.

hard dirac is just a naming scheme for the number 2ei. | = | means something still
needs further statements in between, = | is supposed to mean proven up to a
reduction to algebra. so if you can fully collapse = | and | = | to each sides
of an equation then you possibly have an algebraic derivation iff the result != 0.

x uses only whole numbers 0,1,2,...,n to inf when, +>x is an oblong number

## Complex Number Analysis

An Informal Number x from X is a complex number with an imaginary component
restricted to R/Q.

scratch work:

[ i 1 | 1 i ] x [ i 1 | 1 i ] = [ 0 2i | 2i 0 ]

then ...

[ i e | e i ] x [ i e | i e ] = [ 0 {hard dirac} | 0 {hard dirac} ]

so ...

-1 + ei =| 0

e^2 + ei =| {hard dirac} =| 2ei

e^2 - 1 =| x =| 0

so,

e^i = +/- 1

how,

{hard dirac} =| 0 + 2ei

e^2 =| ei

-1 + ei =| -1 + e^2 =| 0 <=> e^2 =| ei =| 1

0 + 2ei =| e^2 + ei =| 2e^2

=>

e^2 =| +/> 1

## R-Algebra Group Proof

show, e^2 =| +> 1 since e^2 =| ei

<=> e^2 =| 1-1

an informal number is from the set X of informal numbers.

i. e^2 - 1 =| 0 <=> 1*1 =| 0*1 =| 0 <=> 1/0 =| 0

-1 + e^2 =| 0

-1 + 0 =| 0

x =| 0

ii. -1 + ei =| 0 <=> x =| x

iii. e^2 + ei =| 0

1. x =| x

2. x =| 0

3. 1/0 =| 0

## Informal R-Algebra Theory

[ Write Here ]

axiom 1. {hard dirac} =| 0 + 2ei =| e^2 + ei =| +/> 1 + ei =| +/> 2

## R-Calculus

e^2 =| ei =| +> 1 =| 1-1 =| 0

-< 1 |=| ei (1.)

+> 1 |=| -< 1 (2.)

+> 1 |=| -< 1

+> 2 =| 1 + 1/1 =| 1+1 =| {hard dirac} =| 1-1 =| 1 - 1/1 =|-< 2

+>2 =| 2

+> 1 =| 1

-< 1 =| -1

e^2 =| +> 1

e^2 =| 0

e^2 =| 1-1

e^2 =| -< 1

=>

-< 1 |=| ei (1.)

xei =| +> x =| -< x

## Informal Algebra

e^i = +/- 1 \*(1)

e^i\*pi + 1 = 0 # eulers identity

(+/- 1)^pi + 1 =| 0

(+/- 1) + 1 =| 0

e^i + 1 =| 0

e^i =| -1

iln(e) = ln(-1)

iln(e) = i*pi # ln(-1) = i*pi

i = i\*pi # ln(e) = 1

=>

sqrt(1) = +/- 1 = e^i =| -1

=>

sqrt(1) + 1 =| 0

sqrt(n\*n) + n =| 0

+/- n + n =| 0

=>

sqrt(-1) = i = i\*pi = iln(e) = ln(-1) = ln(e^i)

e^sqrt(-1) = e^i = e^ln(e^i)

=>

sqrt(-n) = sqrt(n)*i = sqrt(n)*ln(e^i)

=>

e^sqrt(-1) = e^i = +/- 1 = sqrt(1)

sqrt(n) = e^sqrt(-n)

sqrt(n) = e^i\*sqrt(n)

=>

sqrt(1/4) = 1/2

sqrt(-1/4) = e^sqrt(1/4) = e^i\*sqrt(-1/4) = +/- sqrt(-1/4) = +/- isqrt(1/4)
= +/- i1/2

=>

sqrt(n) = e^sqrt(-n) = e^i\*sqrt(n) = +/- sqrt(n)

sqrt(-n) = +/- isqrt(n)

## i hypothesis (i is an irrational number)

e^i = cos(1) + isin(1) = +/- 1 = 0.54030230586 + isin(1)

=>

isin(1) = 0.45969769414 or -1.54030230586

sin(1) = 0.8414709848

i = 0.45969769414 / 0.8414709848 or -1.54030230586 / 0.8414709848

i = 0.54630248985 or -1.83048772172

## Ordinality of Oblong Addition Relations

+/- ln(e) = 2ei = 1 or 2 or 3 = +/> 2

e^i + ei = 1(ln(e)) or 2 or 3 = +/> 2

+/> 0 = 0 or 1 or -1 = (+/> 1)\*(0)

+/> 0 = +/> 1 \* 0 = 0 or +/> 0 , since (1)

(*1) x = 0 = x*0 = 0\*0 = 0 !

thus,

+>x = +/- x or +/- (x-1) or +/- (x+1) or 0

so, +>x can return a set of either 3,5 or 7 numbers

## Oblong Group Theory

+>x + +>y = +>x - +>y = +y - +>x (1.)

1. both oblong addition and oblong subtraction are commutative

+>x + +>y = {all numbers in both +>x added together} = N

2. the set N can return either 5,7,...,19,21,...,31,33 numbers

3. there are 15 different cardinalities for the set of adding two oblong numbers
   together

## Oblong Number Theory

I wish to officially call +>x oblong numbers

here is a couple simple proofs for the Oblong Number Set.

Solve. +>1 \* +>2

to solve find all unique numbers in [-2,-1,0,1,2] \* [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]

=> {-6,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,6}
note: only the upper triangle of the matrix needs to be calculated

Assume for sake of contradiction division were not possible in the oblong number
set

to be considered an oblong number it'd require for the addition after a division
to be,

contained within the set O of oblong numbers

solve.

## New Calculus

by S i mean integral.

S(2e^2)dx = 2e^2x + c = c + 2xei = c + 2(+>x)

so, e^2x = +>x and +>x = xei thus, +>x is an imaginary component

this means that 2(+>x) + c requires enductive proofs to be able to be related to algebra "R-Algebra"

+>x + +>x = xe^2 + xe^2 = 2xe^2 = 2+>x

so, +>1 + +>1 = 2+>1 NOTEQ +>2

thus, in order to compute 2+>x it'd require H(+>x + +>x) where H relates oblong numbers to the irrationals R/Q

the calculation of the set +>x + +>x is trivial and linear but what computational requirements does H take?
